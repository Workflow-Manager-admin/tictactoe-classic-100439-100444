# Tic Tac Toe Game - Detailed Design Notes

## Layout Structure

The Tic Tac Toe game features a clean, centered layout with the following key sections:

1. **Header Section**
   - Game title "Tic Tac Toe" prominently displayed at the top
   - Possible subtitle or tagline beneath the main title
   - Centered alignment with adequate spacing above the game board

2. **Game Board Section**
   - 3×3 grid layout forming the classic Tic Tac Toe board
   - Grid cells are equal square dimensions
   - Clear borders or dividing lines between cells
   - Centered in the viewport with adequate padding around all sides
   - Cell size is responsive but maintains square aspect ratio

3. **Game Status Area**
   - Located below the game board
   - Shows current player turn (e.g., "Player X's turn")
   - Displays game state messages (e.g., "X wins!", "Draw!")

4. **Control Section**
   - Reset/New Game button below the status area
   - Possible score tracking display showing wins for X, O, and ties
   - Settings or options button (if applicable)

## UI Elements

### Game Board
- **Grid Cells**:
  - Equal-sized square cells arranged in a 3×3 grid
  - Cell borders: 2-3px solid lines in contrasting color to background
  - Empty cell state: clean background with no markers
  - Filled cell states: clear "X" and "O" symbols centered in cells
  - Possible hover state: subtle highlight or shadow when mouse hovers over empty cells
  - Win condition highlight: visual emphasis (color change, animation) on three cells that form a winning line

### Buttons
- **New Game/Reset Button**:
  - Rectangular shape with rounded corners (8px border-radius)
  - Clear button text ("New Game" or "Reset")
  - Padding: 10-12px horizontal, 6-8px vertical
  - Clear hover and active states with visual feedback
  - Positioned centrally below game status area

### Typography
- **Game Title**:
  - Large, bold font (24-28px)
  - Possible playful or geometric font style to match game aesthetic
  - Uppercase or title case with possible letter spacing

- **Game Status Text**:
  - Medium size (16-18px)
  - Clear, readable font
  - Dynamic content changes based on game state
  - Possible color changes to indicate different states (player turn, win, draw)

- **Cell Markers (X/O)**:
  - Large, bold symbols (40-60px depending on cell size)
  - High contrast against cell background
  - Possibly different colors for X and O
  - Centered within cells

## Spacing & Alignment
- **Vertical Spacing**:
  - 24-32px between header and game board
  - 20-24px between game board and status area
  - 16-20px between status area and control buttons

- **Horizontal Alignment**:
  - Game elements centered in viewport
  - Board maintains center alignment regardless of viewport width
  - Consistent padding on left and right of main container (min 16px)

- **Game Board Specific**:
  - Equal cell dimensions (1:1 aspect ratio)
  - Equal spacing between cells (2-3px)
  - Cell size responsive to viewport but with minimum dimensions

## Responsive Behavior
- Board scales appropriately to different screen sizes while maintaining square cells
- Minimum cell size ensured for touch target accessibility
- Overall layout adjusts to portrait/landscape orientations
- Mobile optimizations: larger touch targets, adjusted spacing

## Interactive Elements
- **Cell Interaction**:
  - Click/tap to place X or O marker
  - Visual feedback on hover (desktop)
  - Disabled state for occupied cells
  - Possible animation when placing markers

- **Win Detection**:
  - Visual highlighting of winning pattern (row, column, or diagonal)
  - Possible animation or effect when win occurs
  - Game board locks after win condition or draw

## Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast between game elements
- Adequate text size for readability
- Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support for game status and cell contents
