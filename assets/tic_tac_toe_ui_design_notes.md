## Visual Hierarchy
1. **Game Board** - Largest and most central element
2. **Player Turn Indicator** - Prominent positioning and contrast
3. **Score Cards** - Clear visual grouping below the board
4. **Action Buttons** - Positioned for easy access but not distracting

## Interaction Details

### Cell Interaction
- Cells respond to hover with subtle background change
- Click places the current player's marker
- Once a marker is placed, the cell becomes non-interactive
- Winning cells have a visual indication (highlight/animation)

### Button Interaction
- Buttons have hover and active states
- Restart button resets the board but maintains scores
- New Game button might reset both board and scores

## Responsiveness Notes

The design appears optimized for mobile devices with:
- Comfortable touch targets (large cells)
- Single column layout
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- No horizontal scrolling required

For extremely small screens:
- Padding may reduce to 16px
- Game board might scale down proportionally
- Typography may decrease slightly in size

## Accessibility Considerations

- High contrast between text and backgrounds
- Clear visual indication of game state
- Large touch targets for better usability
- Should include appropriate aria labels and roles for screen readers
- Focus states should be defined for keyboard navigation
